                        <span class="projectSectionHeader">Challenge</span><br>
                        <span>I was tasked with designing a 3D printable prosthetic for a 9-year-old girl that was born with a deformity. I had to try and make the prosthetic as strong as I possibly can, as cheap as I possibly can.</span></span>
                        <br><br>
                            
                        <span class="projectSectionHeader">Solution</span><br>
                        <span>Luckily for me there was a capstone group the previous year that did similar research and helped me narrow down my options. My research partner and I decided to use and modify an open source prosthetic that has already been tested and would work well for our needs.</span>
                        <br><br>

                        <span class="projectSectionHeader">Result</span><br>
                        <span>We were able to get a decently strong product by simply increasing the prints resolution, increasing the infill to 100% and tightening the tolerances of the design. </span>
                        <br><br>
                        
                        <span class="projectSectionHeader">My Contribution</span><br>
                        <span>During the first year and a half of the project I did everything pretty much by my self with a little help here and there from my research advisor. In that time, I tested many different 3D printed infill structures, a resin infill, and coating the outside with carbon fiber. I designed and machined a compression chamber to better bond the test specimen and the carbon fiber. About halfway through the research project, I was allowed to bring in some help. As soon as I had a research partner, I took the roll as the lead and was able to delegate some of the responsibilities. I still conducted tests, 3D printed everything that needed 3D printing, and constantly communicated with the family about their expectations. </span>
