                    <h1>Portable Table Top Gaming Table</h1>
                    <span>
                        Challenge: With the introduction of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, table top gaming as a whole has grown in popularity in the past few years. We wanted to address the mobility and functional needs of the table top gamer.
                        <br><br>
                        Solution: Thinking it wouldn’t be wise to reinvent the wheel, my team and I took a look at the tried and true portable poker table top and improved upon it. 
                        <br><br>
                        Result: Taking little more than its shape and hinge design, my team and I made something that any game master would be proud to display. We took it upon ourselves to make a prototype. 
                        <br><br>
                        My Contribution: As the only member of the team that not only plays table top games, but runs them as well, I provided a great deal of input for desired functionality. During the design process, I provided many of the hand drawings that would later be 3D modeled and fully designed the tray inserts (even though we didn’t get a chance to actually make them).
